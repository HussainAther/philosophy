# Problem solving strategies

When applying algorithms in metaheuristics, computational sciences, and even life sciences, 
we discuss how suitable an application of a given technique can be to a problem and how
the algorithm and problem features can transform. We want to make a distinctino between
strong and weak methods to use more or less specific information respectively. This way
we can create a problem solving strategy summary to suggest ways to apply a given technique
to the function optimization and approximation.

## Suitability of Application

We generally regard tools and techniques with respect to their efficiency or effectiveness
in solving problems. In the philosophy of mathematics and discussions on machine learning,
the "no free lunch theorem" can tell us generally that there are bound claims of applicability
of a given strategy with respect to its feature overlap with the attributes of a given problem
domain. We can describe the appropriateness (can the approach address the problem), feasability
(availability of resoucres and related efficiency concerns), and flexibility (addressing unexpected
or unintended effects). We can address issues of suitability using (1) the systemic elicitatino of 
system and problem features and (2) consideration of overlap of problem-problem, algorithm-algorithm,
and problem-algorithm overlap of features sets.
