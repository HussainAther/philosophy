# Problem solving strategies

When applying algorithms in metaheuristics, computational sciences, and even life sciences, 
we discuss how suitable an application of a given technique can be to a problem and how
the algorithm and problem features can transform. We want to make a distinctino between
strong and weak methods to use more or less specific information respectively. This way
we can create a problem solving strategy summary to suggest ways to apply a given technique
to the function optimization and approximation.
