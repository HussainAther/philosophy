# Philosophy of Heuristics

We may divide heuristics into two different views: the biases and heuristics by Daniel Kahneman
and Amos Tversky and the fast and frugal heuritisc by Gerd Gigerezner. Kahneman and Tversky 
believe judigng the appropriate normative standard for human behavior is terminological while
Gigerezner believes that their bias and heuristic thinking mistakenly referes to all biases as errors.
