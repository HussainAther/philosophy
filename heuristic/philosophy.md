# Philosophy of Heuristics

We may divide heuristics into two different views: the biases and heuristics by Daniel Kahneman
and Amos Tversky and the fast and frugal heuritisc by Gerd Gigerenzer. Kahneman and Tversky 
believe judging the appropriate normative standard for human behavior is terminological while
Gigerenzer believes that their bias and heuristic thinking mistakenly refers to all biases as errors.
