Philosopher James Moore believes artificial intelligence (AI) can be 
an ethical agent that is implicit (has ethical constraints programmed 
into it), explicit (can weigh inputs in a given ethical framework to
choose an action), or full agency (can make ethical judgments and 
defend its reasoning).
