# fMRI

Scientists and philosophers have discussed the assumptions and premises in fMRI research as they relate
to features of the mind. fMRI tends to rely on localizing functions to various parts of the brain, such
as the motor cortex being responsible for controlling muscle groups. Psychologists Stephen Hanson and 
Russell Poldrack and philosopher Martin Bunzl argued brain processing acts holistically with many
parts of the brain acting in tandem with one another for cognitive tasks in their paper "An Exchange 
about Localization of Function." They put forward the thought experiment of a radio repair man
taking a tube from a radio that causes the radio to whistle with the repair man concluding that
he ripped out the anti-whistling tube. The man confuses the function of the effect the same way neuroscientists
in brain lesion and neuroimaging experiments. 

Cognitive scientists who use the brain activity activation to validate cogntiive theories also fall victim to many 
instances of circular reasoning. In some situations they believe that a region in the brain causes an effect on the 
body and these effects an the body cause regions of the brain to activate.

We may further press fMRI researchers for their use of reverse inference of using the instances when brain 
regions activate to infer a cognitive process when the inference depends on the likelihood of the pattern a task
employs a given cognitive process and the likelihood of the pattern of activation for the process. Neuropsychologist
Max Coltheart raised the issue that neuroimaging has not been used in accordance with psychological theory. Philosopher-cognitive
scientist Adina Roskies argued this it's impossible for brain imaging to be consistent with all psychological theories.

Some neuroimaging techniques rely on using a single cognitive process inserted into another set of cognitive processes
without affecting the rest.  

Philosopher-neuroscientist Joshua Greene has performed research using fMRI. Do people ultimately base their mature moral 
judgments on their passions, as sentimentalists such as 18th-century philosopher David Hume argued, or on reason and logic, 
as rationalists such as Immanuel Kant believed?
