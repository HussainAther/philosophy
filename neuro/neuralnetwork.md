# Neural networks as a paradigm

Neural networks form a paradigm for understanding the brain and conducting research in neuroscience and philosophy. Neural
networks in the field of computational neuroscience are more than the computational models of computing systems
that can learn the same way biological neurons do. As philosophers and scientists debated to what extent the brain
is a computer and what the computational theory of mind entails, neural networks became to mean a functional
group of neurons in the brain, an assembly of nerve tissue in a lab, schematics of specific writing, or a microchip
that may encompass all of those roles. Neuroscientist Christof Koch noted that neuroscientists are motivated by 
"the realization that the biophysical, anatomical, and physiological data are necessary to understanding the brain, [but]
they are, unfortunately, not sufficient" in his book "Methods in Neuronal Modeling: From Ions to Networks." 

Neuroscientist Terrence Sejnowski's human visual system neural network research at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute 
at the Salk Institute and University of California, San Diego, lead to the book "The Computational Brain" with philosopher 
Patricia Churchland. MIT computer scientist Shimon Ullman has worked on using the computations of the visual system using
psychological and biological data.
