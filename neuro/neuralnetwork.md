# Neural networks as a paradigm

Neural networks form a paradigm for understanding the brain and conducting research in neuroscience and philosophy. Neural
networks in the field of computational neuroscience are more than the computational models of computing systems
that can learn the same way biological neurons do. As philosophers and scientists debated to what extent the brain
is a computer and what the computational theory of mind entails, neural networks became to mean a functional
group of neurons in the brain, an assembly of nerve tissue in a lab, schematics of specific writing, or a microchip
that may encompass all of those roles.
