# fMRI

Scientists and philosophers have discussed the assumptions and premises in fMRI research as they relate
to features of the mind. fMRI tends to rely on localizing functions to various parts of the brain, such
as the motor cortex being responsible for controlling muscle groups. Psychologists Stephen Hanson and 
Russell Poldrack and philosopher Martin Bunzl argued brain processing acts holistically with many
parts of the brain acting in tandem with one another for cognitive tasks in their paper "An Exchange 
about Localization of Function." They put forward the thought experiment of a radio repair man
taking a tube from a radio that causes the radio to whistle with the repair man concluding that
he ripped out the anti-whistling tube. The man confuses the function of the effect the same way neuroscientists
in brain lesion and neuroimaging experiments. Cognitive scientists who use the brain activity activation
to validate cogntiive theories also fall victim to many instances of circular reasoning. In some situations
they believe that a region in the brain causes an effect on the body and these effects on the body cause regions
of the brain to activate.
