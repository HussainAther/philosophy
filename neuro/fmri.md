# fMRI

Scientists and philosophers have discussed the assumptions and premises in fMRI research as they relate
to features of the mind. fMRI tends to rely on localizing functions to various parts of the brain, such
as the motor cortex being responsible for controlling muscle groups. Psychologists Stephen Hanson and 
Russell Poldrack and philosopher Martin Bunzl argued brain processing acts holistically with many
parts of the brain acting in tandem with one another for cognitive tasks.
