# The epistemology of causality

There are two epistemic approaches to causal theory. Under a hypothetico-deductive account, one hypothesizes 
causal relationships, deduces predictions from the hypothesis, and then tests the hypothesis by seeing how 
well the predictions accord with what actually happens. Under an inductive account, one makes a large number 
of observations and induces causal relationships directly from this mass of data.

## Hypothetico-Deductive discovery

Under this account, one first hypothesizes causal relationships and then tests this hypothesis by seeing whether 
predictions drawn from it are borne out. The testing phase may be influenced by views on the nature of causality: 
a causal hypothesis can be supported or refuted according to whether physical processes are found that underlie 
the hypothesised causal relationships, whether probabilistic consequences of the hypothesis are verified, and 
whether experiments show that by manipulating the hypothesised causes one can achieve their effects.

Karl Popper was an exponent of the hypothetico-deductive approach. For Popper a causal explanation of an event 
consists of natural laws (which are uni- versal statements) together with initial conditions (which are single-
case statements) from which one can predict by deduction the event to be explained. The initial conditions are 
called the 'case' of the event to be explained, which is in turn called the effect. Causal laws, then, are just universal laws, and are to be discovered via Popper's general scheme for scientific discovery: (i) hypothesise the laws; 
(ii) deduce their consequences, rejecting the laws and returning to step (i) if these consequences are falsified 
by evidence. Popper thus combines what is known as the covering-law account of causal explanation with a hypothetico-deductive 
account of learning causal relationships.
