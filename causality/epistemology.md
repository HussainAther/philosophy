# The epistemology of causality

There are two epistemic approaches to causal theory. Under a hypothetico-deductive account, we hypothesize
causal relationships and deduce predictions based on them. We test these hypotheses and predictions by comparing
empirical phenomena and other knowledge and information on what actually happens to these theories. We may also
take an inductive approach in which we make a large number of appropriate, justified observations (such as a set of data) 
from which we can induce causal relationships directly from them.  

## Hypothetico-Deductive discovery

The testing phase of this account of discovery and causality uses the views on the nature of causality to determine
whether we support or refute the hypothesis. We search for physical processes underlying the causal relationships
of the hypothesis. We can use statistics and probability to determine which consequences of hypotheses are verified, 
like comparing our data to a distribution such as a Gaussian or Dirichlet one. We can further probe these consequences
on a probabilistic level and show that changing hypothesized causes can predict, determine, or guarantee effects.  

Philosopher Karl Popper advocated this approach for causal explanations of events that consist of natural laws, which
are universal statements about the world. He designated initial conditions, single-case statements, from which we may
deduce outcomes and form predictions of various events. These case initial conditions call for effects that we can 
determine, such as whether a physical system will approach thermodynamic equilibrium or how a population might
evolve under the influence of predators or external forces. Popper delineated the method of hypothesizing laws,
deducing their consequences, and rejecting laws that aren't supported as a cyclical process. This is the covering-law
account of causal explanation.  

## Inductive learning

Philosopher Francis Bacon promoted the inductive account of scientific learning and reasoning. From a very high-number of 
observations of some phenomenon or event with experimental, empirical evidence where it's appropriate, we can compile
a table of positive instances (in which a phenomenon occurs), negative instances (it doesn't occur), and prartial instances 
(it occurs to a certain degree). This gives a multidimensionality to phenomena that characterize causal relationships from
both *a priori* and *a posterior* perspectives. 

The mainstream of inductivist artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have the following feature in common. In order 
that causal relationships can be gleaned from statistical relationships, the approaches assume the Causal Markov 
Condition holds of physical causality and physical probability.205 Of course a causal net contains the Causal Markov 
Condition as an inbuilt assumption. In the case of structural equation models the Causal Markov Condition is a 
consequence of the representation of each variable as a function just of its direct causes and an error variable, 
given the further assumption that all error variables are probabilistically independent.

The inductive procedure then consists in finding the class of causal models or under some approaches a single 'best' 
causal model whose probabilistic independencies implied via the Causal Markov Condition are consistent with independencies 
inferred from the data. Other assumptions are often also made, such as minimality (no submodel of the causal model also 
satisfies the Causal Markov Condition), faithfulness (all independencies in the data are implied via the Causal Markov 
Condition), linearity (all variables are linear functions of their direct causes and uncorrelated error variables), 
causal sufficiency (all common causes of measured variables are measured), context generality (every individual 
possesses the causal relations of the population), no side effects (one can intervene to fix the value of a 
variable without changing the value of any non-effects of the variable), and determinism. However, these extra 
assumptions are less central than the Causal Markov Condition: approaches differ as to which of these extra 
assumptions they adopt and the assumptions tend to be used just to facilitate the inductive procedure based on 
the Causal Markov Condition, either by helping to provide some justification of the inductive procedure or by 
increasing the purported efficiency or efficacy of algorithms for causal induction.
