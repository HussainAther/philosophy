# The epistemology of causality

There are two epistemic approaches to causal theory. Under a hypothetico-deductive account, one hypotheses 
causal relationships, deduces predictions from the hypothesis, and then tests the hypothesis by seeing how 
well the predictions accord with what actually happens. Under an inductive account, one makes a large number 
of observations and induces causal relationships directly from this mass of data.
