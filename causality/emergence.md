# Contextual emergence

Contextual emergence characterizes a specific kind of relationship between different 
domains of scientific descriptions of particular phenomena. Although these domains 
are not ordered strictly hierarchically, one often speaks of lower and higher levels 
of description, where lower levels are considered as more fundamental in a certain 
sense. As a rule, phenomena at higher levels of description are more complex than 
phenomena at lower levels. This increasing complexity depends on contingent conditions, 
so-called contexts, that must be taken into account for an appropriate description.

The basic idea of contextual emergence is to establish a well-defined interlevel relation 
between a lower level L and a higher level H of a system. This is done by a two-step 
procedure that leads in a systematic and formal way (1) from an individual description 
Li to a statistical description Ls and (2) from Ls to an individual description Hi. 
This scheme can in principle be iterated across any connected set of descriptions, so 
that it is applicable to any case that can be formulated precisely enough to be a 
sensible subject of a scientific investigation.

The essential goal of step (1) is the identification of equivalence classes of individual 
states that are indistinguishable with respect to a particular ensemble property. This step 
implements the multiple realizability of statistical states in Ls (which will be the basis 
for individual states in Hi) by individual states in Li. The equivalence classes at L can 
be regarded as cells of a partition. Each cell is the support of a (probability) distribution 
representing a statistical state, encoding limited knowledge about individual states

The essential goal of step (2) is the assignment of individual states at level H to coextensional 
statistical states at level L. This is impossible without additional information about the 
desired level-H description. In other words, it requires the choice of a context setting the 
framework for the set of observables (properties) at level H that is to be constructed from 
level L. The chosen context provides conditions that can be implemented as stability criteria at 
level L. It is crucial that such stability conditions cannot be specified without knowledge 
about the context at level H. In this sense the context yields a top-down constraint, or 
downward confinement (sometimes misleadingly called downward causation).

The notion of stability induced by context is of paramount significance for contextual emergence. 
Roughly speaking, stability refers to the fact that some system is robust under (small) 
perturbations - for instance, if (small) perturbations of a homeostatic or equilibrium 
state are damped out by the dynamics, so that the initial state is (asymptotically) retained. 
The more complicated notion of a stable partition of a state space is based on the idea of 
coarse-grained states, i.e. cells of a partition whose boundaries are (approximately) maintained under the dynamics.

Stability criteria guarantee that the statistical states of Ls are based on a robust partition 
so that the emergent observables in Hi are well-defined. (For instance, if a partition is not 
stable under the dynamics of the system at Li, the assignment of states in Hi will change over 
time and, thus, will be ill-defined.) Implementing a contingent context of Hi as a stability 
criterion in Li yields a proper partitioning for Ls. In this way, the lower-level state 
space is endowed with a new, contextual topology.

From a slightly different perspective, the context selected at level H decides which details 
in Li are relevant and which are irrelevant for individual states in Hi. Differences among all 
those individual states at Li that fall into the same equivalence class at Ls are irrelevant 
for the chosen context. In this sense, the stability condition determining the contextual 
partition at Ls is also a relevance condition.

The interplay of context and stability across levels of description is the core of contextual 
emergence. Its proper implementation requires an appropriate definition of individual and statistical 
states at these levels. This means in particular that it would not be possible to construct 
emergent observables in Hi from Li directly, without the intermediate step to Ls. And it would 
be equally impossible to construct these emergent observables without the downward confinement 
arising from higher-level contextual constraints.

In this spirit, bottom-up and top-down strategies are interlocked with one another in such a way 
that the construction of contextually emergent observables is self-consistent. Higher-level 
contexts are required to implement lower-level stability conditions leading to proper lower-level 
partitions, which in turn are needed to define those lower-level statistical states that are 
co-extensional (not necessarily identical) with higher-level individual states and their associated observables.

As an example, consider the transition from classical point mechanics over statistical mechanics to 
thermodynamics (Bishop and Atmanspacher 2006). Step (1) in the discussion above is here the step from 
point mechanics to statistical mechanics, essentially based on the formation of an ensemble distribution. 
Particular properties of a many-particle system are defined in terms of a statistical ensemble description 
(e.g., as moments of a many-particle distribution function) which refers to the statistical state of 
an ensemble (Ls) rather than the individual states of single particles (Li).

An example for an observable associated with the statistical state of a many-particle system is its 
mean kinetic energy, which can be calculated from the the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of the momenta 
of all N particles. The expectation value of kinetic energy is defined as the limit of its mean value 
for infinite N.

Step (2) is the step from statistical mechanics to thermodynamics. Concerning observables, this is the 
step from the expectation value of a momentum distribution of a particle ensemble (Ls) to the temperature 
of the system as a whole (Hi). In many standard philosophical discussions this step is mischaracterized 
by the false claim that the thermodynamic temperature of a gas is identical with the mean kinetic energy 
of the molecules which constitute the gas. A proper discussion of the details was not available for a 
long time and has been achieved by Haag et al. (1974) and Takesaki (1970) in the framework of quantum 
field theory.

The main conceptual point in step (2) is that thermodynamic observables such as temperature presume 
thermodynamic equilibrium as a crucial assumption serving as a contextual condition. It is formulated 
in the zeroth law of thermodynamics and not available at the level of statistical mechanics. The very 
concept of temperature is thus foreign to statistical mechanics and pertains to the level of thermodynamics 
alone. (Needless to say, there are more thermodynamic observables in addition to temperature. Note that 
also a feature so fundamental as irreversibility in thermodynamics depends crucially on the context of 
thermal equilibrium.)

The context of thermal equilibrium (Hi) can be recast in terms of a class of distinguished statistical 
states (Ls), the so-called Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states. These states are defined by the KMS 
condition which characterizes the (structural) stability of a KMS state against local perturbations. 
(More precisely, this includes stationarity, ergodicity, and mixing). Hence, the KMS condition 
implements the zeroth law of thermodynamics as a stability criterion at the level of statistical 
mechanics. (The second law of thermodynamics expresses this stability in terms of a maximization 
of entropy for thermal equilibrium states. Equivalently, the free energy of the system is minimal 
in thermal equilibrium.)

Statistical KMS states induce a contextual topology in the state space of statistical mechanics (Ls) 
which is basically a coarse-grained version of the topology of Li. This means nothing else than a 
partitioning of the state space into cells, leading to statistical states (Ls) that represent equivalence 
classes of individual states (Li). They form ensembles of states that are indistinguishable with 
respect to their mean kinetic energy and can be assigned the same temperature (Hi). Differences 
between individual states at Li falling into the same equivalence class at Ls are irrelevant with 
respect to a particular temperature at Hi.

While step (1) formulates statistical states from individual states at the mechanical level of 
description, step (2) provides individual thermal states from statistical mechanical states. 
Along with this step goes a definition of new, emergent thermal observables that are coextensive, 
but not identical with mechanical observables. All this is guided by and impossible without 
the explicit use of the context of thermal equilibrium.

The example of the relation between mechanics and thermodynamics is particularly valuable for 
the discussion of contextual emergence because it illustrates the two essential construction 
steps in great detail. There are other examples in physics and chemistry which can be discussed 
in terms of contextual emergence: emergence of geometric optics from electrodynamics, emergence 
of electrical engineering concepts from electrodynamics, emergence of chirality 
as a classical observable from quantum mechanics, emergence of diffusion and friction of a 
quantum particle in a thermal medium, emergence of hydrodynamic properties from many-particle theory.
