# Contextual emergence

Contextual emergence characterizes a specific kind of relationship between different 
domains of scientific descriptions of particular phenomena. Although these domains 
are not ordered strictly hierarchically, one often speaks of lower and higher levels 
of description, where lower levels are considered as more fundamental in a certain 
sense. As a rule, phenomena at higher levels of description are more complex than 
phenomena at lower levels. This increasing complexity depends on contingent conditions, 
so-called contexts, that must be taken into account for an appropriate description.

The basic idea of contextual emergence is to establish a well-defined interlevel relation 
between a lower level L and a higher level H of a system. This is done by a two-step 
procedure that leads in a systematic and formal way (1) from an individual description 
Li to a statistical description Ls and (2) from Ls to an individual description Hi. 
This scheme can in principle be iterated across any connected set of descriptions, so 
that it is applicable to any case that can be formulated precisely enough to be a 
sensible subject of a scientific investigation.

The essential goal of step (1) is the identification of equivalence classes of individual 
states that are indistinguishable with respect to a particular ensemble property. This step 
implements the multiple realizability of statistical states in Ls (which will be the basis 
for individual states in Hi) by individual states in Li. The equivalence classes at L can 
be regarded as cells of a partition. Each cell is the support of a (probability) distribution 
representing a statistical state, encoding limited knowledge about individual states

The essential goal of step (2) is the assignment of individual states at level H to coextensional 
statistical states at level L. This is impossible without additional information about the 
desired level-H description. In other words, it requires the choice of a context setting the 
framework for the set of observables (properties) at level H that is to be constructed from 
level L. The chosen context provides conditions that can be implemented as stability criteria at 
level L. It is crucial that such stability conditions cannot be specified without knowledge 
about the context at level H. In this sense the context yields a top-down constraint, or 
downward confinement (sometimes misleadingly called downward causation).

The notion of stability induced by context is of paramount significance for contextual emergence. 
Roughly speaking, stability refers to the fact that some system is robust under (small) 
perturbations - for instance, if (small) perturbations of a homeostatic or equilibrium 
state are damped out by the dynamics, so that the initial state is (asymptotically) retained. 
The more complicated notion of a stable partition of a state space is based on the idea of 
coarse-grained states, i.e. cells of a partition whose boundaries are (approximately) maintained under the dynamics.

Stability criteria guarantee that the statistical states of Ls are based on a robust partition 
so that the emergent observables in Hi are well-defined. (For instance, if a partition is not 
stable under the dynamics of the system at Li , the assignment of states in Hi will change over 
time and, thus, will be ill-defined.) Implementing a contingent context of Hi as a stability 
criterion in Li yields a proper partitioning for Ls . In this way, the lower-level state 
space is endowed with a new, contextual topology.
