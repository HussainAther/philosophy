# Contextual emergence

Contextual emergence characterizes a specific kind of relationship between different 
domains of scientific descriptions of particular phenomena. Although these domains 
are not ordered strictly hierarchically, one often speaks of lower and higher levels 
of description, where lower levels are considered as more fundamental in a certain 
sense. As a rule, phenomena at higher levels of description are more complex than 
phenomena at lower levels. This increasing complexity depends on contingent conditions, 
so-called contexts, that must be taken into account for an appropriate description.

The basic idea of contextual emergence is to establish a well-defined interlevel relation 
between a lower level L and a higher level H of a system. This is done by a two-step 
procedure that leads in a systematic and formal way (1) from an individual description 
Li to a statistical description Ls and (2) from Ls to an individual description Hi. 
This scheme can in principle be iterated across any connected set of descriptions, so 
that it is applicable to any case that can be formulated precisely enough to be a 
sensible subject of a scientific investigation.

The essential goal of step (1) is the identification of equivalence classes of individual 
states that are indistinguishable with respect to a particular ensemble property. This step 
implements the multiple realizability of statistical states in Ls (which will be the basis 
for individual states in Hi) by individual states in Li . The equivalence classes at L can 
be regarded as cells of a partition. Each cell is the support of a (probability) distribution 
representing a statistical state, encoding limited knowledge about individual states.
