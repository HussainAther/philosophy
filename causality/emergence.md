# Contextual emergence

## What is contextual emergence?

Contextual emergence is a specific kind of relationship between different
domains of scientific descriptions of particular phenomena. Although these domains 
are not ordered strictly hierarchically, one often speaks of lower and higher levels 
of description in which emergence occurs. From the lower levels (L), more fundamental in a certain
sense, phenomena emerge in higher levels (H) in more complex phenomena. Strings of DNA in a genome
may correspond to different transcripts on an transcriptome level for an individual. Chaotic conditions
may emerge from certain differential equations subject to certain constraints. This complexity depends
on the conditions of the context. Hence, contextual emergence.

Contextual emergence involves  well-defined relationships between different levels of complexity.
We can use a two-step procedure to create a systematic, formal way that an individual
description (Li) creates a statistical description (Ls) among the lower level. This process
can lead us to decribe individuals at a higher level (Hi). We iterate this process (Li -> Ls -> Hi) through
sets of descriptions connected with one another to reveal what emerges at higher levels.

During this method, we identify equivalence classes of individual states that are indistinguishable
with respect to a certain property of the entire system. We can realize different statistical
states in Ls by individual states in Li. Each state has limited knowledge, but, together,
we can create probability distributions represent the statistical states Ls. This could be how
spike signals from neural circuits encode for higher-level functions in the brain.

Then, we can assign individual states at the higher level H to coextensional statistical states at level L.
We use a top-down constraint. This needs information about the higher description to choose a
context setting the framework for the set of observable properties at level H created from L.
We can implement stability criteria at level L such that the appropriate context emerges at level H.
The stability refers to the ability for the features of the system to remain valid even under
small changes. This includes equilibrium states of gas systems and homeostatic relationships
between units of biological mechanisms such as glycolysis. We may also define stability as systems
that have boundaries maintained under the dynamics specified for it We may choose to confine ourselves
to certain electrochemical properties that emerge from membrane dynamics in synaptic networks. This allows
the emergent properties to remain well-defined from the contextual topology of L. It also
tells us which properties of L are relevant to the contextual emergence of H.

This interplay between upward and downard strategies lets the system remain self-consistent.
moving from a higher context to a lower one requires the stability conditions to lead to lower-level
partitions of the system while moving to a higher context means the statistics of lower-level states
extend to higher-level individual states we can observe.

## Point mechanics to statistical mechanics to thermodynamics

We can even demonstrate the relationship between different fields of science through contextual
emergence. Moving from classical point mechanics, involving forces due to gravitational effects and
electromagnetism, to statistical mechanics to thermodynamics illustrates this phenomena. From point mechanics
to statistical mechanics particles or other individual units (Li) form ensemble distributions which can be
studied using statistics. We can define many-particle systems with statistical ensemble descriptions (Ls)
like momenta or energy of distributions, such as the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for N particles. From there,
we can find mean kinetic energy, Gibbs free energy, entropy, and other statistical quantities.

We can observe expectation values of momenta distrubitioins of particle ensembles to calculate temperature
of the system as a higher-level function (Hi) on the assumption the system is in equilibrium. The zeroth law
of thermodynamics does not come from statistical mechnics, but from thermodynamics. Other features such as
irreversibility and adiabatic nature emerge as well. We can characterize this thermal equilibrium (Hi)
using Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states, defined by the condition that characterizes the structural
stability of a KMS state against local perturbations or changes. This leads to stationarity, ergodicity,
and mixing using the zeroth law of thermodynamics to define the system as stable. We can
also use the second law of thermodynamics to express the stability in maximization of entropy
for thermal equilibrium states.

The first step of the contextual emergence process (Li -> Ls) describes statistical states from the individual
states, and the second gives indiidual thermal states from statistical mechanical states. Other examples may
include emergence of geometric optics from electrodynaimcs, electrical engineering features from electrodynamics,
chirality from quantum mechanics, and diffusion or friction of a quantum particle in a thermal medium. Neuroscientists
have even found use in contextually emerging cognitive states from nerual correlates.

## Hodgkin-Huxley equations

The Hodgkin-Huxley equations that describe generation and propagation of action potentisl form a system
fo four ordinary nonlinear differential equations: an electric conductance equation for transmemberane
currents and three master equations for the opening kinetics of sodium and potassium channels. These
lower-level stochastic (using Markov processes as transition probabilities) phenomena lead to higher-level
descriptions of ion channel function to characterize a deterministic dynamic system. We can treat ion channels
as macro-molecular quantum objects with the Schrödinger equation for many particles. The Schrödinger equation
describes a highly entangled state of electrons and atomic nuclei as a whole, and, on a moleculr level,
the structure of a closed or open pore of an ion channel through the Born-Oppenheimer approximation
separates electronic and nucleonic wave functions. Then, we can use the electronic quantum dynamics
in a constrainted rigid nucleonic frame that has a classical spatial structure. This stoachstic spatial structure
gives the equations of the Hodgkin-Huxley system as a contextually emergent phenomenon.

## Mental states emerging from neuroscience

To realize mental states from neural states, we specify the L level as neuron states of neural assemblies
in the brain with respect ot H, a class of mental states that reflects the situation under study. We may use
experimental protocols that include a task for subjects to define mental states while recording brain states.
We may use individual neuron properties Li to find Ls such taht statisical states have equivalence classes
of those individual states. The differences must be irrelevant with respect to the higher level H. Philosopher
David Chalmers said a neural correlate of a conscious mental state can be mulltiply realized by "minimally sufficient
neural subsystems correlated with states of consciousness" in "What is a neural correlate of consciousness?"
We can look at phenomenal families, sets of mutualyl exclusive phenomenal mental states that jointly
partition a space of mental states. Creature consciousness can give us refined levels of phenomenal states
of background consciousness (awake, dreaming, etc.), wake consciosuness (perceptual, cognitive, affective, etc.),
perceptual consciousness (visual, audotiry, tactile, etc.), and visual consicousness (color, form, location, etc.). With
one of these contexts, we choose stability criterion at Ls that has complicated neurodynamics to find robust, proper
 statistical states.
 
 We may describe L-dynamics and H-dynamics meshing with one another if coarse graining and time
 evolution commute with one another. We create meshes, parts of space differentiated by complexes of cells
 between the two levels, that follow from higher-level stability criterion. The coarse graining means fine details
 of the system can be smoothed over, as entropy of the system increases, such that we can make predictions
 about the system as a whole.
 
 Contextual emergence could help artificial intelligence approach its potential while accounting for the inherent,
 intrinsic differences between science and philosophy. We may model the mind as a contextual emergent phenomena of the
 neurophysiology of the brain. As we learn about the owrld, we can account for emergent phenomena when addressing
 issues in science and philosophy, and AI would benefit from these methods of understanding. AI could avoid the
 issues of reductionism using higher-level emergetn bheavior resulting from neural networks in the human brain.
 Bacpropogation of neural networks lets us optimize the gap between reality and models they represnt using
 feedback loops with optimal weights of individual neruons when optimized for emergetn details. The same way
 a human can differentiate between a picture of an lion and a lion itself using the emergent phenomena of
 visual images that appear together to create a lion, intelligent machines can embrance contextual emergence to
 view the work with inquisitive wonder and curiosity to learn. 

We can represent proper cells with basins of attraction and chaotic attractors with coarse-grained generating
partitions. These partitions of the system lead to Markov chains with a rigorous theoretical constraint
for the propert definition of stable mental states. The mathematical techniques come from ergodic theory and
symbolic dynamics.

The emergence of metnal states from electroencephalogram (EEG) dynamics shows
that data from subjects with EEG data from sporadic epileptic seizures can correlate with mental states
of the seizures themselves. Using a 20-channel EEG recording, we get a 20-dimension state space
that we reduce to a lower number through principal component restrictions. We find a homogeneous grid
of cells to set up a Markov transition matrix that reflects the EEG dynamics using fine-graned auxilary
partition. Then, this matrix gives eigenvalues that characterize time scales for which the dynamics can
be ordered by size. The eigenvectors span an eigenvector space such that the measure principal component
states form a simplex. The three leading eigenvalue give a neural state repesentation that has a 2-simplex
with three vertices, or a triangle. We can further classify neural states by distance frmo the vertices
of the simplex to clusters of neural data. In the principal component state space, the clsuters appear
as non-intersecting convex sets between mental states. We may alos use recurrence
structure analysis to partition the state space into recurrent clusters such that they overlap from the
recurrence plot of the dnyamical system. We figure out the metastable states and transitions
between them using a Markov chain with one distinguished transient state and other states representing
the metastable states in the dynamics.

## Intentionality

Philosopher Daniel Dennett describes the intentional stance of the prediction of an system's behavior
too complex to be treated as either a physical or desgined system. Intentional systems behave in predicted
ways by ascribing beliefs and desires to their internal states. From thermostats to chess computers,
we can make predictions of a system with necessary and sufficient coonditions. The system's dynamics have
to be non-trivial, so this excludes linear systems with periodic oscillations or damped relaxations. We construct
an intentional hierarchy from general case of nonlinear nonequilibrium dissipative systems
to more specific intentional systems. A physical system's physical nature is necessary for being a nonlinear
dissipative nonequilibrium system while a nonlinear dissipative nonequiliibrium nature is necessary for
an intentional system. An intentional system is necessary for being a true believer, according to Dennett.
Sufficient conditions in the intentinoal hierarchy implement contextual stability conditions.

The transition from equilibrium thermodynamcis to fluid dynamics represents phenomenal laws of fluid
dynamics (like the Navier-Stokes equation) emerging from statistical mechancis under the assumption of
local equilibrium. Sufficient boundary conditions give rise to self-organization, such as through "magnetic snakes."
We give a rationality constraint for optimal dissipation of pumped energy, and true believers emerge contextually
as intentional systems under mutual adoption of the intentional stance.

## Symbolic grounding

The symbolic grounding problem is the problem fo assigning meaning to symbols on purely syntactic grounds.
Cognitivists such as philosophers Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn have described this problem. It can also describe
how the question of how conscious mental states can be characterized by neural correlates. The relation between analog
and digital systems such that syntactic digital symbols relate to the analog behavior of a system they descibe
symbolically needs to be further examined through dnyamical automata. Piecewise linear time-discrete
maps over a two-dimensional state space assume the interpretation as symbolic computers through a rectangular
partition of the unit square. A single point trajectory is not fully interpretable as symbolic computation.
We need higher-level macrostates from ensembles of state space points, or probability distributions of points,
taht evolve under the dynamcis.

Writer Beim Graben showed only uniform probability distributions that have rectangular support exhibit
a stable dynamics can be interpreted as computation. The huge space of possible probability distributions can be
contextually resctricted toa subclass of uniform probability distributions to create meaningfully gorunded symbolic
processes. Symbolic grounding is contextually emergent.

## Mental causation

Describing the mind as causally reelvant in a physical world introduces the problem of mental causation, the quesiton
of how mental phenomena can be highly signficant in psychology and cognitive neuroscience. It means creating
a notion of agency that includes the causal efficacy of mental states. This causal efficacy of mental phenomena
seems inconsistent with vertical (interlevel, synchronic) determination of the mental state by neural correlates.
Philosophy Jaegwon Kim argued supervenience (also known as exclusion) describes the problem that mental states
are either causally inefficacious or have the threat of overdetermining neural states. Either mental events play
nor horizontally determining causal role at all or they're the causes of the neural bases of their relevant horizontal mental
effects. Contextual emergence through different levels of complexity means the conflict between horizontal
and vertical determination of mental events isn't an issue. We can define proper mental states from dynamics
of an underlying neural system through statistical enrual states on proper partitions with individual mental states.

This construction implies that the mental dynamics and the neural dynamics, related to each other 
by a so-called intertwiner, are topologically equivalent. Instead of some mutually exclusive duality of the mental
and the neural, we have a monistic idea that they are part of one and the same concept, albeit related to one another
in a signficiant way. We can describe it using dual-aspect monism using symmetry breakdown conceptually prior
to the opposite of generalization. When symmetries between entities restore themselves, we osberve the similarities brought upon
by the symmetries and generate equivalence classes of increasing size that can describe contextually emergent phenomena.
Given properly defined mental states, the neural dynamics gives rise to a mental dynamics that is
independent of those neurodynamical details that are irrelevant for a proper construction of mental states. Mental states
can be causally and horizontally related to other metnal states, and they neither cause their vertical neural determiners nor
cause the horizontal effects of the neural determiners. This resolve the problem of mental causation in a deflationary manner.
Vertical and horizontal determination don't compete against one another. They work cooperatively.

Mental causation is a horizontal relation between previous and future mental states with effectiveness
given by the vertical relation (the downward relation of neural states from higher-level mental constraints).
Psychophysical neutral elementary entitres are composed to sets of such entities that depend on the composition
of these sets in a way they acquire mental or physical properties. The psychophysically neutral domain does not
have elementary entiteis waiting to be composed, but, rather, has one overarching whole to be decomposed into
its parts. The mental and material from a psychophysicall neutral whole causes a contextual emergence
that requires a new technical explanation and a metaphysical one.

The technical framework refers to the contextual emergence of multiplicity from unity. The "primordial" decomposition
of an undivided whole generates different domains that gives rise to differentiations, such as the mind-matter distinction.
The psychophysical neutral reality is the trivial, completely symmetric partiiton in which nothing is ditinguished from one another.
We can decompose this to give rise to more and more refined partiitons in which symmetries are broke nadn equivalence
classes become smaller and smaller. Phenomenal families of mental states emerge.

On a metaphysical level, mental and physical epistemic limits describe the undivided whole as an
ontic (physical factual existence) dimesnion. They reminesce of philosopher Plato's abstract perfect ideas and
philosopher Immanuel Kant's things-in-thesmelves (empirically inaccessible in principle and specifically mute).
The mind-matter problem causes an emergence of mind-matter correlations as direct and immediate consequence
of the ontic, undivided whole that can't be further divided without introducing more distinctions. Many describe
determinism as a feature of ontic descriptions of states and observables while stochasticity uses epistemic descriptions.
Mathematical models of classical point mechanics are most common examples of deterministic descriptions and three
properties of them are important. (1) The differential dynamics mean the system's evolution obeys a differential equation
in a space of ontic states. (2) The unique evolution of the system means initial and boundary conditions
give a unique trajectory. (3) The value determinateness assumes that any state can be described with arbitrarily small error.
These three features define a hierarchy ofr the contextual emergence of determinstic descriptions assuming
(1) is a necessary condition for determinism, (2) can be proven under sufficient condition that trajectories
created by a vector field obeying (1) pass through points whose distance is stable under small pertubrations. We assume (2)
for almost every intiial condition as a necessary condition of determinism that defines a phase flow with weak
causality. To prove (3), we need strong causality as a sufficient condition. The deterministc dynamics
of Kolmogorov flow implement microscopic chaos as a stability condition. It's also possible a continuous stochastic
process that fulfills the Markov criterion can lead to a determnistic "mean-field equation."

Different descriptive levels can correlate with different degrees of granularity. Lower-level descriptions
address systems in terms of micro-properties while more global macro-properties account for higher-level descriptions.
Philosophy Bas van Fraassen noted the explanatory relativity, in which explanations are not only
relationships between theories and factse, but three-place relations between theories, facts, and contexts.
Contexts determine relevance of explanation backed by relevance critera for reproduciibity in science, especially in interdisciplinary
fields such as bioinformatics or computational neuroscience. This gives a framework for discussing contextual emergence
alongside theories and facts as they relate to explanations. We consider the granularity of descriptions
that we observe when descriptive levels transform between one another and their associated granularities
by the interlevel relation of contextual emergence. This gives a formally sound and empirically applicable
procedure to construct level-specific criteria for relevant observables across disciplines.

## Reductionism and ontology

 It may seem appealing to reduce every system down to its fundamental components and conclude that every empirical phenomena
 in science or other disciplines is only applied mathematics. But this misses out on the features of the whole that emerge in the contexts
 of the higher layers which cannot be reduced. Consciousness among neural and metnal correlates of different states provide one example,
 but we only need to look at any example, such as the emergence of transcriptome interactions from how a genome itself structures itself,
 to realize that these properties come about only at the higher levels, and, therefore, involve phenomena that are not completely reducible to
 mathematics. Biolgist Peter Corning argued in "The Re-Emergence of "Emergence": A Venerable Concept in Search of a Theory" that whole systems
 produce unique combined effects that may involve the context between and the interactions with the system and its environment

Contextual emergence has been originally conceived as a relation between levels of descriptions, 
not levels of nature: It addresses questions of epistemology rather than ontology. In agreement with Esfeld, 
who advocated that ontology needs to regain more significance in science, it would be desirable to 
know how ontological considerations might be added to the picture that contextual emergence provides.

Various granularity degrees raises quesitons of descirptions with finer grains as they relate to the fundamental
nature of systems when compared to coarser grains. The majority of scientists and philosophers of science answer
believe this, so there's one fundamental ontolgoy that elementary particle physics result from reducing
other descriptive levels. This reductive premise produced critical assessments and alternatiev proposals.
Philosopher Willard Van Oramn Quine introduced the ontological relatively that, if there is one
ontology that fulfills a given descripive theory, there is more than one. Philosopher Hilary Putnam devloped
a related kind of ontological relativity, first called internal realism, and later refferd to as pragmatic realism.

We may apply Quine's ideas to concrete scientifci descriptions, their relationships with one another, and their
referents. A descriptive framework can be ontic or epistemic depending on which other framework it relates to.
An engineer may consider wires of an electrical circuit to be ontic, but a solid-state physicist may consider them epistemic.
We can use the relevance criteria to distinguish between context-specific decsriptions and avoid pitfalls of reductionism.
We create a subtle and more flexible framework while still restricting ourselves to the premises and limits of the contextually emergent model.

## Strong and weak emergence

Weak emergence involves emergent properties that computer simulations can control such that the interacting cells
of the system retain their indepedence. Other emergent properties, irreducible to the system's constituent parts, are strong.
Both are supervenient and involve novel properties as the system grows, but the distinction introduces a scale-dependency to
observable phenomena.
