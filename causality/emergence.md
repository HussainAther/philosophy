# Contextual emergence

Contextual emergence characterizes a specific kind of relationship between different 
domains of scientific descriptions of particular phenomena. Although these domains 
are not ordered strictly hierarchically, one often speaks of lower and higher levels 
of description, where lower levels are considered as more fundamental in a certain 
sense. As a rule, phenomena at higher levels of description are more complex than 
phenomena at lower levels. This increasing complexity depends on contingent conditions, 
so-called contexts, that must be taken into account for an appropriate description.
