# Metaphysics of causality

We can pose questions about the mathematization of causality even with the research
and methods that have dominated the work on probability and its consequences. We can
speculate what causality is and the opinions on the nature of causality as they relate
to the axioms and definitions that have remained stable in the theories of probability
and statistics.

We can elaborate three types of causality approaches. The first is that causality
is only a heuristic and has no role in scientific reasoning and discourse, as philosopher
Bertrand Russel argued. Science depends upon functional relationships, not casual laws. 
The second position is that causality is a fundamental feature of the world, a universal principle.
We should, therefore, treat it as a scientific primitive. This position evolved out of 
conflict with purported philosophical analyses that appealed to asymmetry of time (that it
moves in one direction) to explain the asymmetry of causation (that they move in one direction 
and one direction only). This raises concerns of how to interpret time in terms of causality.
The third is we can reduce causal relations to other concepts that don't involve causal notions.
Many philosophers support this position, and, as such, there are four divisions within this
position. 

We will suppose here that causality is a relation between variables and that these variables 
are single-case or repeatable according to the interpretation of causality in question. 
An interpretation of causality is mental if it views causality as a feature of an agent's 
epistemic state and physical if a feature of the world external to an agent. An interpretation 
is subjective if two agents with the same background knowledge can disagree as to causal 
relationships yet both be correct, and objective if causal relationships are not a matter of arbitrary choice. 

The mechanistic account of causality aims to understand the physical processes that link 
cause and effect, interpreting causal statements as saying something about such processes. 
Wesley Salmon and Phil Dowe are two influential proponents of this type of position. 
They argue that a causal process is one that transmits or possesses a conserved physical quantity, 
such as energy-mass, linear momentum or charge, from start (cause) to finish (effect).

The mechanistic account is clearly a physical interpretation of causality, since it 
identifies causal relationships with physical processes. Such a notion of cause relates 
single cases, since only they are linked by physical processes, although causal regularities 
or laws may be induced from single-case causal connections. Causal mechanisms are understood 
objectively: if two agents disagree as to causal connections then at least one is wrong.

The main limitation of this approach is its rather narrow applicability: most of our causal 
assertions are apparently unrelated to the physics of conserved quantities. While it may be 
possible that physical processes such as those along which quantities are conserved could 
suggest causal links to physicists, such pro- cesses are altogether too low-level to suggest 
causal relationships in economics, for instance. One could maintain that the economists' 
concept of causality is the same as that of physics and is reducible to physical processes 
but one would be forced to accept that the epistemology of such a concept is totally 
unrelated to its metaphysics. This is undesirable: if the grounds for knowledge of a 
causal connection have little to do with the nature of the causal connection as it is analyzed 
then one can argue that it cannot be the causal connection that we have knowledge of, but something else.
