# Metaphysics of causality

We can pose questions about the mathematization of causality even with the research
and methods that have dominated the work on probability and its consequences. We can
speculate what causality is and the opinions on the nature of causality as they relate
to the axioms and definitions that have remained stable in the theories of probability
and statistics.

We can elaborate three types of causality approaches. The first is that causality
is only a heuristic and has no role in scientific reasoning and discourse, as philosopher
Bertrand Russel argued. Science depends upon functional relationships, not casual laws. 
The second position is that causality is a fundamental feature of the world, a universal principle.
We should, therefore, treat it as a scientific primitive. This position evolved out of 
conflict with purported philosophical analyses that appealed to asymmetry of time (that it
moves in one direction) to explain the asymmetry of causation (that they move in one direction 
and one direction only). This raises concerns of how to interpret time in terms of causality.
The third is we can reduce causal relations to other concepts that don't involve causal notions.
Many philosophers support this position, and, as such, there are four divisions within this
position. 

The first schism we discuss is that causality is a relation between variables that are single-case
or repeatable according to the interpretation of causality in question. We interpret causality
as a mental in nature given that causality is a feature of an agent's epistemic state and physical
if it's a feature of the external world. We interpret it as subjective if two agents with the 
same relevant knowledge can disagree on a conclusion of the relationships with both positions correct,
as though they were a matter of arbitrary choice. Otherwise we interpret it as objective. The subjective-objective
schism raises issues between how different positions would be regarded as correct and what determines
the subjective element or role subjectivity plays in these two different positions. 

The second partition is the mechanistic account of causality - that physical processes link
cause and effect. We interpret causal statements as giving information about these processes.
Philosophers Wesley Salmon and Phil Dowe advocate this position as they argue causal processes
transmit or have a conserved physical quantity to them. We may describe the relation between
energy and mass (E = mcÂ²) as causal relations from start (cause) to a finish (effect). One may argue
against this position on the grounds that these relations in science have no specific direction one 
way or another and are symmetrical and not subject to causality. It does, however, relate single
cases linked by physical processes even if we can induce causal regularities or laws from these 
connections in an objective manner. If two people disagree on the causal connections, one or both 
are wrong. 

This approach is difficult to apply. The physics of theseq quantities aren't determined
by the causal relations themselves. The conservation of these physical quantities may suggest
causal links to physicists, they aren't relevant in the fields that emerge from physics such as
chemistry or engineering. This would lead one to believe the epistemology of the causal concepts 
are irreelvant to their metaphysics. If this were the case, the knowledge of a causal relationship
would have little to do with the causal connection itself.  

The third subdivision is probabilistic causality in which we treat casual connections with probabilistic
relationships of variables. We can debate which probabilistic relationships among variables of probabilistic
causality determine or create causal relationships. One might say the Principle of Common Cause (if two variables
are probabilistically dependent, then one causes the other or they're effects of common causes that make them
indepedent from one another). Philosopher Hans Reichenbach applied this to causality to provide a probabilistic
analysis of time in its single direction. More recent philosophers use the Causal Markov Condition as a necessary
condition for causality with other less central conditions. We normally apply probabilistic causality
to repeatable variables such that probability handles them, but critics may argue the Principle of the Common
Cause and the Causal Markov Conditions have counterexamples hsowing they don't hold in under all conditions.

Finally, the fourth subclass is the counterfactual account, as advocated by philosopher David Lewis. In this way, we reduce
causal relations to subjunctive conditions such that an effect depends causally on a cause if and only iff (1) if
the cause were to occur, then the effect would occur (or its chance to occur would raise significantly) and (2) if
the cause didn't occur then the effcet wouldn't occur. The transitive closure of the Causal Depedendence (that a cause
will either increase the probability of a direct effect or, if it's a preventative, make the effect less likely, as long
as the effect's other direct causes are held fixed) holds. The causal relationships are what goes on in possible
worlds that are similar to our own. Lewis introduced counterfactual theory to account fo the causal relationships between
single-case events and causal relationships that are mind-independent and objective. We may still press this account
by arguing that we have no physical contact with these possible worlds or that there isn't an objective way to determine
which wordls are closest to our own or which worlds we should follow and analyze in determining causality. The counterfactualist
may respond that the worlds we choose are the ones in which the cause-and-effect relationship occur as closer to our own world
and, from there, determine which appropriate world is closest to our own.
