# Metaphysics of causality

While the mathematical theory of probability is well-developed and its axioms and 
main definitions have remained stable for a number of years, there is no consensus 
regarding the mathematisation of causality. Neither is there much agreement as to 
what causality is. We explore some of the array of opinions on the nature of causality.

There are three varieties of position on causality. One can argue that the concept 
of causality is of heuristic use only and should be eliminated from scientific discourse: 
this was the tack pursued by Bertrand Russell, who maintained that science appeals 
to functional relationships rather than causal laws. Alternatively one can argue 
that causality is a fundamental feature of the world and should be treated as a scientific 
primitive—this claim is usually the result of disillusionment with purported philosophical 
analyses, several of which appeal to the asymmetry of time in order to explain the 
asymmetry of causation, a strat- egy that is unattractive to those who want to 
analyze time in terms of causality. Or one can maintain that causal relations can be 
reduced to other concepts not involving causal notions. This latter position is 
dominant in the philosophical literature, and there are four main approaches which can 
be described roughly as follows.

We will suppose here that causality is a relation between variables and that these variables are single-case or repeatable according to the interpretation of causality in question. An interpretation of causality is mental if it views causality as a feature of an agent’s epistemic state and physical if a feature of the world external to an agent. An interpretation is subjective if two agents with the same background knowledge can disagree as to causal relationships yet both be correct, and objective if causal relationships are not a matter of arbitrary choice. 
The mechanistic account of causality aims to understand the physical processes that link cause and effect, interpreting causal statements as saying something about such processes. Wesley Salmon and Phil Dowe are two influential proponents of this type of position. They argue that a causal process is one that transmits or possesses a conserved physical quantity, such as energy-mass, linear momentum or charge, from start (cause) to finish (effect).
The mechanistic account is clearly a physical interpretation of causality, since it identifies causal relationships with physical processes. Such a notion of cause relates single cases, since only they are linked by physical processes, although causal regularities or laws may be induced from single-case causal connections. Causal mechanisms are understood objectively: if two agents disagree as to causal connections then at least one is wrong.
The main limitation of this approach is its rather narrow applicability: most of our causal assertions are apparently unrelated to the physics of conserved quantities. While it may be possible that physical processes such as those along which quantities are conserved could suggest causal links to physicists, such pro- cesses are altogether too low-level to suggest causal relationships in economics, for instance. One could maintain that the economists’ concept of causality is the same as that of physics and is reducible to physical processes but one would be forced to accept that the epistemology of such a concept is totally unrelated to its metaphysics. This is undesirable: if the grounds for knowledge of a causal connection have little to do with the nature of the causal connection as it is analysed then one can argue that it cannot be the causal connection that we have knowledge of, but something else.
