# Metaphysics of causality

While the mathematical theory of probability is well-developed and its axioms and main definitions have remained stable for a number of years, there is no consensus regarding the mathematisation of causality. Neither is there much agreement as to what causality is. We explore some of the array of opinions on the nature of causality.

There are three varieties of position on causality. One can argue that the concept of causality is of heuristic use only and should be eliminated from scientific discourse: this was the tack pursued by Bertrand Russell, who maintained that science appeals to functional relationships rather than causal laws. Alternatively one can argue that causality is a fundamental feature of the world and should be treated as a scientific primitiveâ€”this claim is usually the result of disillusionment with purported philosophical analyses, several of which appeal to the asymmetry of time in order to explain the asymmetry of causation, a strat- egy that is unattractive to those who want to analyse time in terms of causality. Or one can maintain that causal relations can be reduced to other concepts not involving causal notions. This latter position is dominant in the philosophical literature, and there are four main approaches which can be described roughly as follows.
