We say that a theory is falsified only if we have accepted basic statements which contradict
it (cf. section 11, rule 2). This condition is necessary, but not sufficient; for we have seen
that non-reproducible single occurrences are of no significance to science.

Thus a few stray basic statements contradicting a theory will hardly induce us to reject it as falsified.
We shall take it as falsified only if we discover a reproducible effect which refutes the theory. In other words,
we only accept the falsification if a low-level empirical hypothesis which describes such an effect is
proposed and corroborated. This kind of hypothesis may be called a falsifying hypothesis.

The requirement that the falsifying hypothesis must be empirical, and so falsifiable, only means that it must
stand in a certain logical relationship to possible basic statements; thus this requirement only concerns the
logical form of the hypothesis. The rider that the hypothesis should be corroborated refers to tests which it
ought to have passedâ€”tests which confront it with accepted basic statements.
