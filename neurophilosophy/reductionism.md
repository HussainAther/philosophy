# Are mental states reducible to neurobiological states?

Examining arguments of how neuroscience and psychology relate to philosophy by 
looking at how skeptics and enthusiasts have touched upon the subject.

## Principled skepticism

These skeptics may argue there is a distinctive mental dimension that is not reducible
to anything physical. Among them are those that argue this mental dimension actually
harbors a separate mental substance as the nonphysical mind or the soul (substance dualism) or 
whether its limited to nonphysical properties of the physical brain (property dualism). 
There are also skeptics who argue a principled skepticism of reductionism uses the hypothesis that 
generalizations of psychology emerge with respect to the generalizations of neuroscience. 
Mental states and processes create a domain of study that's autonomous with respect to neuroscience 
with functionalist arguments. They reject the dualist position.

### Substance dualism

Mental states are not of the brain, but a different substance. It requires explanation
for the way two different substances may interact and how the nonphysical mind creates
those mental states. They must also account for free will in a nonphysical mind. Ultimately
consciousness and qualities of felt experience may be explained with neurobiological terms or 
the logical-meaningful dimension may have a causal neurobiological explanation. Generally
the dualist philosophers that attempt to explain the subjective experience may treat it
as an irreducible property, in what we call property dualism. 

These property dualists argue that, although there are nontrivial differences among
the hypotheses advanced by assorted property dualists, they maintain that, even if 
the mind is the brain, subjective experience qualities are emergent with respect to the
brain and its properties. The commonsense conceptual framework to understand psychological
properties in a way that doesn't reduce to any future neuroscience. Within intertheoretic
reduction, we recognize subjective experiences won't reduce to neuroscience. Property dualists
don't believe there's a nonphysical substance inherent to experiences. They believe
subjective experiences are produced by the brain and affect the brain even if they 
aren't actual physical properties of the brain.

Philosopher Frank Jackson used the thought experiment of Mary the neuroscientist to show
that differences between knowing our states through introspection and knowing through
nonintrospection give the grounds to reduce psychology to neuroscience. The thought
experiment supposes Mary is a neuroscientist who has lived her entire live in a room
with no colors, yet she is still taught everything about how the brain works. Even if 
she knows everything about the brain, she still doesn't have the experience of seeing
color. There's something in psychology not captured by neuroscience. It's possible these
two methods of knowing about the world are subject to different learning methods. Others
may argue that Mary would still be able to identify the color red as it is an empirical
question.

Dualist theories may include our capacity for introspection just as light still exists
as a phenomena even if it may be reduced to electromagnetic radiation. A reductionist
may also believe an evolved psychology can reduce to an evolved neuroscience.

## Functionalism

Acknowledging there are categories of folk pyschology that are incorrect for categorizing
mental states, these categories delimit intentional states and logical processes, and they
don't reduce to categoies ar the neurobiological level of description. In this context, we 
introduce functionalism as the thesis that mental states are defined in terms of their abstract
causal roles in the wider information-processing system. We characterize mental states
as they relate to causal relations of environmental stimuli.
