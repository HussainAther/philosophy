# Are mental states reducible to neurobiological states?

Examining arguments of how neuroscience and psychology relate to philosophy by 
looking at how skeptics and enthusiasts have touched upon the subject.

## Principled skepticism

These skeptics may argue there is a distinctive mental dimension that is not reducible
to anything physical. Among them are those that argue this mental dimension actually
harbors a separate mental substance as the nonphysical mind or the soul (substance dualism) or 
whether its limited to nonphysical properties of the physical brain (property dualism). 
There are also skeptics who argue a principled skepticism of reductionism uses the hypothesis that generalizations of psychology emerge with respect to the 
generalizations of neuroscience. Mental states and processes create a domain of study that's autonomous
with respect to neuroscience with functionalist arguments. They reject the dualist position.
