# Are mental states reducible to neurobiological states?

Examining arguments of how neuroscience and psychology relate to philosophy by 
looking at how skeptics and enthusiasts have touched upon the subject.

## Principled skepticism

These skeptics may argue there is a distinctive mental dimension that is not reducible
to anything physical. Among them are those that argue this mental dimension actually
harbors a separate mental substance as the nonphysical mind or the soul (substance dualism) or 
whether its limited to nonphysical properties of the physical brain (property dualism). 
There are also skeptics who argue a principled skepticism of reductionism uses the hypothesis that 
generalizations of psychology emerge with respect to the generalizations of neuroscience. 
Mental states and processes create a domain of study that's autonomous with respect to neuroscience 
with functionalist arguments. They reject the dualist position.

### Substance dualism

Mental states are not of the brain, but a different substance. It requires explanation
for the way two different substances may interact and how the nonphysical mind creates
those mental states. They must also account for free will in a nonphysical mind. Ultimately
consciousness and qualities of felt experience may be explained with neurobiological terms or 
the logical-meaningful dimension may have a causal neurobiological explanation. Generally
the dualist philosophers that attempt to explain the subjective experience may treat it
as an irreducible property, in what we call property dualism. 

These property dualists argue that, although there are nontrivial differences among
the hypotheses advanced by assorted property dualists, they maintain that, even if 
the mind is the brain, subjective experience qualities are emergent with respect to the
brain and its properties.
