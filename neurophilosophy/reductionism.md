# Are mental states reducible to neurobiological states?

Examining arguments of how neuroscience and psychology relate to philosophy by 
looking at how skeptics and enthusiasts have touched upon the subject.

## Principled skepticism

These skeptics may argue there is a distinctive mental dimension that is not reducible
to anything physical. Among them are those that argue this mental dimension actually
harbors a separate mental substance as the nonphysical mind or the soul (substance dualism) or 
whether its limited to nonphysical properties of the physical brain (property dualism).
