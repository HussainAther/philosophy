# The brain-computer interface

An output of a computer depends on its program, input, and functional stages that lead to the output.

## Intentionality 

If we treat propositional attitudes with intentionality as a physical properties, we can build a computer
with states that have genuine intentionality. But no computer model that stimulates human propositional
attitudes will have genuine intentional states. Intentionality of propositional attitudes isn't a physical
property.
