# The brain-computer interface

An output of a computer depends on its program, input, and functional stages that lead to the output.

## Intentionality 

If we treat propositional attitudes with intentionality as a physical properties, we can build a computer
with states that have genuine intentionality. But no computer model that stimulates human propositional
attitudes will have genuine intentional states. Intentionality of propositional attitudes isn't a physical
property. 

We may consider the network theory of meaning (or holistic theory or conceptual-role theory) such that the meaning
of an expression plays a role in its internal representatinoal economy. This way it relates to sensory input and
behavioral output. Meaning is relational as an expression's meaning is a function of its inferential and computational
role in a person's internal system.
