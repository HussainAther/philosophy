In researching how scientists form conclusions and how fast various groups
of researchers can discover significan results, philosophers Weisberg and Muldoon
created 3D "epistemic landscapes" in which the x and y axes of a graph represent
research programs with the vertical z axis the scientific importance of the results
attainable by the research program. They created algorithms for three processes:
(1) scientists follow the control research strategy and ignore what other scientists
are doing, (2) scientists follow methods of research their predecessors used, and (3)
scientists take into account results of others such that, if a method has already been
explored, they adopt a different one.
