# The limits of reasoning and inference

In determining how machines differ from humans, we can observe intelligence and 
various methods of reasoning through the physical universe itself. With the connectedness 
of physics and theory of computation, we can study how physical devices perform 
observation, prediction, and recollection to compare them to our own methods of 
doing the same. Whatever common features or universal patterns we may observe 
among machines performing these functions, we can determine the inferences the 
universe makes and, in the future, continue comparing them to how humans function. 
For machine automata and cellular automata, these methods of inference hold insight 
for how reasoning varies among phenomena in the physical universe. 

We can also define an inference complexity as the analog of Kolmogorov complexity of computing a string. 

Semantic information content of a variable s concerning a variable r is what an 
external scientist can infer about what the value of r is in their particular universe by 
knowing the state of s.
