"""
Stephen Wolfram believes cellular automata (CAs) can be grouped into
four classes based on their behavior. 

Class 1 is the simplest in which CAs evolve from almost any starting
    condition to the same uniform pattern.
Class 2 generates a simple pattern with nested structure such that
    the pattern contains many smaller versions of itself. Some Class 2
    CAs can generate patterns that are intricate and beautiful, and still
    simple.
Class 3 has randomness.
Class 4 are common in the natural world.
